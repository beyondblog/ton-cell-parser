# TON Cell Parser

TON Cell Parser is a web application for parsing Cell data in the TON blockchain. It supports parsing various common Cell operations, such as Jetton transfers, Jetton internal transfers, Jetton notifications, and Excess messages. Additionally, it provides a custom parsing mode that allows users to manually parse arbitrary Cell data. Most of the code in this tool is generated by AI

## Features

- Parse Jetton transfer operations
- Parse Jetton internal transfer operations
- Parse Jetton notification operations
- Parse Excess messages
- Custom parsing mode for manually parsing arbitrary Cell data
- Real-time display of parsing results
- Syntax highlighting for JSON-formatted parsing results

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/beyondblog/ton-cell-parser.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd ton-cell-parser
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## How to Use

1. Paste the BOC (Bag of Cells) data of a Cell into the input field.
2. Click the "Parse" button.
3. If the Cell data matches a known operation type, the parsing result will be displayed below.
4. If the Cell data doesn't match any known operation type, the application will switch to the custom parsing mode.
5. In the custom parsing mode, select the desired parsing action (e.g., loadUint, loadAddress) and enter the corresponding value (if required).
6. Click the "Parse" button in the custom parsing mode to execute the selected parsing action.
7. The parsing result will be displayed in real-time, with syntax highlighting for better readability.
